<h2>Overview</h2><p>
Faculty of Computer Systems & Software Engineering was established on 16 February 2002 
to produce knowledgeable, high skilled and competitive graduates within the sphere of 
software engineering, system and computer network. At the beginning, the faculty had two 
fields which are Software Engineering and Networking.
</p>
<p>
The faculty has also embarked on research and development activities in the area such as 
information systems, software engineering, computer systems, communication systems, 
graphic and multimedia technology to produce technologies that are relevant to the needs of 
industries. Currently, the faculty has four research groups which are Network & Security, 
Modeling & Simulation, Data Mining & Knowledge Management and Graphic & Image 
Processing to support university's focus groups (Manufacturing & Automotive and Chemical & 
Biotechnology).
</p>
<p>
The faculty emphasizes on the development and growth of its students's enrolment and 
graduates. Through high quality teaching (by completing specific quality outcome and generic 
skills), great laboratories facilities, proper and careful advising and numerous professional 
activities, our students have opportunity to excel in the classroom and laboratory session. In a 
personable atmosphere, the students become well prepared in the term of software 
engineering knowledge and technical skills. Thus, they are ready and confident to begin their 
professional career or further their studies.
